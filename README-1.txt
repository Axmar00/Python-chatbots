INFO AND EXPLANATION: client.py and server.py 

There are 3 bots the client.py can choose from: ash, misty and brock


1. Start by running the server.py in a terminal window with the port as the argument.
2. The server will then go in listen-mode and wait for connections and let us know if somebody connections
4. Open up 2-3 terminals, or how many the user wants, but there are only 3 bots available.
5. One should also open one terminal for the host-client, aka. the user. The program should however allow more users.
6. Start client.py in the new terminals with 3 arguments: IP-adress, port and name. The name decides whether you're a bot or a user.
7. The chatroom should now be intact. The user can write whatever he/she desires, and the bot(s) will respond accordingly.
8. The bots will have seperate responses for a set of given verbs. 
9. To stop everything, one can simply close the terminal windows. The clients and the server will notify you when somebody disconnects.
